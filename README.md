A simple (for now) card game engine written in coffee-script. More to
come like realistic shuffling and cutting.

Right now, the compiled js file will run under nodejs and play a game
of War and display some output about the game including the rounds and
the winner of the game. The code that handles the 'war' case is
particularly ugly, but that could be refactored.

This is my first foray into coffee-script.
